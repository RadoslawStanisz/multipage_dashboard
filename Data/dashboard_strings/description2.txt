The table to the right is also interactive. You can choose between monthly and weekly timeframes, filter the table 
(just type in e.g., "January" or "First Class" in the second row of the adequate column - case sensitive).
Finally, you can export the data to .xlsx (excel). The last column calculates the % change concerning subtotal column. 
It compares the chosen subtotal value with the value from the previous month/week.
Positive values are highlighted with green background, negative with red.

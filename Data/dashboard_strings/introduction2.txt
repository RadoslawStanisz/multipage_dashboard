This page focuses on delays analysis. The first chart shows peak travel times. Peak travel times are determined by 
number of scheduled departures per given hour. Therefore cancelled departures are also included. This chart also shows how many departures were on time, delayed and cancelled.
Note that departure times are binned into 24 full hours meaning that if the departure took place at 19:45, it belongs to '19' in the chart. 
The chart is interactive, you can isolate particular trace/traces by clicking/unclicking it in the legend pane. 
Finally, if you hover over any of the charts, the tooltip displays more details.
